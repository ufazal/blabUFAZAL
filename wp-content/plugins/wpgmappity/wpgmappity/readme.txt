Point, Click, Map. Insert Google Maps in your posts using just a web form inside Wordpress. All WYSIWYG: no JavaScript, no XML, no coding at all.

== Description ==

WPGMappity allows you to easily insert Google Maps into your posts.  Unlike other plug-ins that require the use of XML data or JavaScript coding, building your Google Map is accomplished completely in a WYSIWYG web form inside of Wordpress.  

Project Home: [http://www.wordpresspluginfu.com/wpgmappity/](http://www.wordpresspluginfu.com/wpgmappity/)

Features from Google Maps that are supported in the current release include:

* Map Size
* Zoom Level
* Map Centre
* Map Type (normal, satellite, hybrid)
* Map Alignment in your post
* Add Markers to you map
* Allow clicking markers to open a Google Maps HTML window with text and links

After the plugin is installed, your can build Google Maps and display them in your Wordpress posts by popping open the “edit Post” window like normal. There will be a new item in the Media Upload row at the top of your post (a “G” inside a grey box). Click the button to build your Google Map.



== Installation ==

If you do not already have a Google Maps API key you will need to obtain one from Google in order to display their maps on your web site.

Installation Instructions:

* Upload the full directory into your wp-content/plugins directory.
* Activate the plugin on the plugin administration page.
* A yellow box at the top of the admin panel will inform you that you need to enter a Google Maps API key.  Click the link offered to visit your WPGMappity Configuration page.
* Cut and Paste your API key in the box and click “Update API Key”.
* Thats it! The plugin is now available for use.
