The only plugin that can properly audit your themes and plugins for LARGE multisite installations (1000+ sites)

== Description ==

The Multisite Auditor gives details on which sites are using which themes and which plugins. This plugin is optimised and designed for large multisite installations that have more than 1000 sites. However, it will also work very well with smaller networks.


**Features**

*   Displays data and stats for each any every theme and plugin
*   Shows theme use across the entire network
*   Shows plugin use across the entire network
*   Quickly view the most popular themes and most activated plugins
*   Shows themes that no longer exist - i.e. broken sites
*   Easily bulk switch sites using one theme from another
*   Uses jQuery datatables for much easier sorting / searching that the standard WP tables
*   Audit your site once - data is kept to date automatically
