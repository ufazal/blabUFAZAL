=== Twitter ReTweet ===Contributors: chromaticsitesDonate link: http://www.cancer.org/docroot/don/don_0.aspTags: twitter, retweet, google analyticsRequires at least: 2.5Tested up to: 2.7Stable tag: 1.0Simple plugin used for a complex purpose: ReTweet custom links on specific blog pages/posts.== Description ==Twitter ReTweet provides a function that displays a ReTweet link which gives visitors the ability to ReTweet the currentpost; supports custom URLs (perfect for Google Analytics Campaign Tracking).== Installation ==This plugin is really easy to use. There are a few simple steps that must be taken prior to installing the plugin:1. Fill in the Profile ('/wp-admin/profile.php') field 'Nickname' with your Twitter username. This allows us to bypass any custom database modifications. Hey, it's there - why not use it?1. Each post that you would like to utilize the custom ReTweet link must have a 'custom field' called retweet_url. It is through the use of this custom field that we are able to dynamically pull the encoded URL related to each post. If you don’t fill in this custom field for a post, then the ReTweet link will be absent from that post and the plugin will degrade without a hitch.1. If you’d like to style the link (perhaps you want to use a CSS image rollover instead of a plain Jane link), the CSS class is reTweetPost.Once you’ve completed the aforementioned steps, follow these step by step instructions to activate the plugin:1. Move the 'twitter-retweet' folder into your 'wp-content/plugins' directory and upload to your remote server1. Login to your WordPress account1. Navigate to the 'Plugins' section or go directly to '/wp-admin/plugins.php'1. Activate the 'Twitter ReTweet' plugin1. Copy and paste the following code into the desired template(s) (we use the single.php template); the code should be placed within the WordPress loop: 	`<?php if(function_exists('twitterReTweet')) {		echo twitterReTweet();	}?>`1. Save and upload the modified template file(s)1. If you’ve done everything correctly, then you should see the ReTweet link on the pages/posts that have the 'retweet_url' custom field filled in. The link, when clicked, will fill the following information into the visitor’s Twitter.com status box (they will need to click the 'Update' button to post it): 'RT @username: Post Title - hyperlink'. Our real world example is located beneath the author box of this post.== Frequently Asked Questions === How is this different from other Twitter ReTweet plugins? =This plugin gives you the ability to add in custom URLs via the custom field feature in WordPress. If you'd like to track a campaign using Google Analytic's Campaign Tracking feature, this gives you the ability to add the necessaryquery to the end of the URL. You can then use a URL shortening service (TinyURL.com) so that the link is an appropriatesize for micro-blogging. No other Twitter ReTweet plugin gives you this ability since all of the URLs are automaticallygenerated.== Screenshots ==1. No Screenshots.== Arbitrary section ==
