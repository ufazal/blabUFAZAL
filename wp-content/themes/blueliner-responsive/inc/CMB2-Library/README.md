CMB2 Code Snippet Library
========================

This is a community-maintained repository of code snippets that help modify the default behavior of [CMB2](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2/).

Snippets are organized into categories (folders) and each snippet is placed in its own file with a name that describes what it does.

Thank you to the EDD team for [the inspiration](https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/library) for this library.
