<h3>To write a post: </h3>
<ol>
  <li> Log in to the WordPress Dashboard. </li>
  <li> Click the 'Posts' tab on the left sidebar to make sure its opened.</li>
  <li> Click the 'Add New' button wich will open up a new blank post for you to fill in.</li>
  <li> Start filling in the blanks: enter your post title in the   upper field, and enter your post content in the main post editing   box below it. </li>
  <li> then As needed, select a category the post belongs to from the categories panel on the right side of the page.</li>
  <li> When you are ready, click <strong>Publish</strong>. </li>
</ol>
<p>Thats it.</p>
<p><img src="posts.jpg" alt="posts" width="174" height="182" hspace="20" align="left" /></p>
<p> all posts on the site are made the same exact way. you will primarily be working off of that Posts Panel<br />
</p>
<p>clicking   &quot;posts&quot; will display a list of all posts on the site. &quot;Add new&quot; will take you to a new window to create a new post.</p>
<p>&quot;categories&quot; will take you a page listing all the categories in the site, and you can add new categories.</p>
<p>&quot;post tags&quot; does the same thing, only listing out and letting you add new Tags. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Blog Categories and NEWS posts:</h3>
<p>categories are the various labels used to organize blog and news posts. Each category can have &quot;child&quot; categories. this is just a way to organize subjects.</p>
<p><img src="cats.jpg" width="606" height="339" alt="cats" /></p>
<p>for example, &quot;content marketing&quot; is a parent category, and it has 3 child categories. you will notice that child categories are always indented a little, this reflects how its listed</p>
<p>when making regular blog posts, just select whatever categories are appropriate. you can select as many or as few categories as you want in any order/combination.</p>
<p style="color: #093">the one thing to remember though... is that there are 4 categories reserved for the news section. we need to keep those categories seperate.(explaination below)</p>
<p style="color: #093">and there is a &quot;home featured&quot; category reserved for the home page slider. (explanation below)</p>
<p style="color: #093">outside of those categories... the blog posts can have any other tags/categories you want.</p>

<h2>Making &quot;news&quot; posts :</h2>
<p><img src="news.jpg" width="296" height="333" hspace="20" align="left" /></p>
<p>When you make a new &quot;news&quot; post, you have 4 check boxes to worry about.</p>
<p> Always select &quot;NEWS&quot; and then select the sub-section it belongs to.</p>
<p>what this is about, is that when you visit a news post like...</p>
<p>http://www.bluelinerny.com/news/b-labs-ajustco-shareholder-meeting.php</p>
<p>youll see how the page template is different from a blog post like...</p>
<p>http://www.bluelinerny.com/blog/recovering-from-panda-4-0.php</p>
<p>both of those posts were made the same exact way, the template will just show a different page depending on the categories you choose.</p>
<p>so when you want to make a news post, select ONLY the news category AND one of child categories (events, in the news, or latest news)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>selecting one of the child categories will make sure the post link goes under the right heading onthe news page automatically</p>
<p>http://www.bluelinerny.com/news.php</p>
<p>so 'regular' blog posts should NEVER have one of the news section categories selected. as that will cause wordpress to use the news section template.</p>
<hr />
<h2>home page slider :</h2>
<p>all that is, is that each &quot;slide&quot; is a simple wordpress post with ONE image in it. and the post has the &quot;home featured&quot; category selected.</p>
<p>thats it.</p>
<p>i recommend doing it like this.</p>
<ol>
  <li>go to write a new post as normal</li>
  <li>give it a title starting with &quot;slider&quot; followed by whatever you want.</li>
  <li>insert an image sized 720x315 pixels.</li>
  <li>give it a link to another page if needed.</li>
  <li>select &quot;home featured&quot; from the categories box</li>
  <li>publish</li>
</ol>
<p>some times we want to remove or replace an old featured image. its easy to find.</p>
<ul>
  <li>from the wordpress dashboard click &quot;posts&quot; and a list of all posts show up.</li>
  <li>at the top of the page, look for the dropdown button that says &quot;view all categories&quot; </li>
  <li>and scroll to the home featured&quot; category and then click the filter button.</li>
</ul>
<p>now youll just see a few of the &quot;home featured&quot; posts that populate the slider. from here you can delete or edit any outdated slider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
